This is an experiment in using Blender and Photoshop to create a new working ship model.

I've borrowed heavily from other OXPs and Oolite resources (you can read more on my blog
at http://blog.justinpinner.net/elite/creative-corner/)

In summary, this OXP adds a souped-up Cobra model that smoothes out some of the sharp
edges of the original Mk3 and features a colour scheme designed to make it harder to
spot in-game. The motors are beefed up (and cargo space reduced as a result) and the 
handling has also been pushed up a lot - probably too much if I'm honest).

Admittedly the stealth features have no practical effect yet. You're still going to
appear on other ship's radars just as before, but it's really a pre-cursor to the
time when (if) I ever get the multiplayer side of things off the ground.

In the meantime. Enjoy!
